# Ligolo-NG

## This repo is just to maintain operating instructions that I can use quickly and easily.  I have in ***NO WAY*** come up with this tool, nor is this an original thought.  

## All credit goes to `nicocha30` and his repo, to include releases, can be found at `https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng/`
